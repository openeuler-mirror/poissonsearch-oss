== Getting Started with Shield

This getting started guide walks you through installing Shield, setting up basic authentication, and getting started with role-based
access control. You can install Shield on nodes running Elasticsearch {version}.

IMPORTANT: The Shield plugin must be installed on every node in the cluster. If you are installing 
to a live cluster, you must stop all of the nodes, install Shield, and restart the nodes. You cannot
perform a rolling restart to install Shield.

To install and run Shield:

. Run `bin/plugin install` from `ES_HOME` to install the license plugin.
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------
bin/plugin install license
----------------------------------------------------------

. Run `bin/plugin install` to install the Shield plugin.
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------
bin/plugin install shield
----------------------------------------------------------
+
NOTE: If you are using a <<deb-rpm-install, DEB/RPM distribution>> of Elasticsearch, you need to specify the configuration directory and run the installation with superuser permissions. To perform an offline installation, <<offline-install,download the Shield binaries>>.

. Start Elasticsearch.
+
[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------
bin/elasticsearch
----------------------------------------------------------

. To verify that Shield is up and running, check the startup log entries. When Shield is operating normally, the log indicates that the network transports are using Shield:

[source,shell]

Now you're ready to secure your cluster! Here are a few things
you might want to do to start with:

* <<enable-basic-auth, Control Access with Basic Authentication>>
* <<enable-message-authentication, Enable Message Authentication>>
* <<enable-auditing, Enable Auditing>>
