X-Pack includes a SQL feature to execute SQL against Elasticsearch
indices and return tabular results. There are four main components:

<<sql-rest,REST API>>::
    Accepts SQL in a JSON document, executes it, and returns the
    results.
<<sql-translate,Translate API>>::
    Accepts SQL in a JSON document and translates it into a native
    Elasticsearch query and returns that.
<<sql-cli,CLI>>::
    Command line application that connects to Elasticsearch to excute
    SQL and print tabular results.
<<sql-jdbc,JDBC>>::
    A JDBC driver for Elasticsearch.
