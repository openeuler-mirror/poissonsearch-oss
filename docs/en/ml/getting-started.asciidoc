== Getting Started

////
{xpack} {ml} features automatically detect:
* Anomalies in single or multiple time series
* Outliers in a population (also known as _entity profiling_)
* Rare events (also known as _log categorization_)

This tutorial is focuses on an anomaly detection scenario in single time series.
////
Ready to get some hands-on experience with the {xpack} {ml} features? This
tutorial shows you how to:

* Load a sample data set into Elasticsearch
* Create a {ml} job
* Use the results to identify possible anomalies in the data


At the end of this tutorial, you should have a good idea of what {ml} is and
will hopefully be inspired to use it to detect anomalies in your own data.

[[ml-gs-sysoverview]]
=== System Overview

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you will need the following
components of the Elastic Stack:

* Elasticsearch {version}, which stores the data and the analysis results
* {xpack} {version}, which provides the {ml} features
* Kibana {version}, which provides a helpful user interface for creating and
viewing jobs +


See the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Elastic Support Matrix] for
information about supported operating systems.

See {stack-ref}/installing-elastic-stack.html[Installing the Elastic Stack] for
information about installing each of the components.

NOTE: To get started, you can install Elasticsearch and Kibana on a
single VM or even on your laptop. As you add more data and your traffic grows,
you'll want to replace the single Elasticsearch instance with a cluster.

When you install {xpack} into Elasticsearch and Kibana, the {ml} features are
enabled by default. If you have multiple nodes in your cluster, you can
optionally dedicate nodes to specific purposes. If you want to control which
nodes are _machine learning nodes_ or limit which nodes run resource-intensive
activity related to jobs, see <<ml-settings>>.

[float]
[[ml-gs-users]]
==== Users, Roles, and Privileges

The {xpack} {ml} features implement cluster privileges and built-in roles to
make it easier to control which users have authority to view and manage the jobs,
data feeds, and results.

By default, you can perform all of the steps in this tutorial by using the
built-in `elastic` user. If you are performing these steps in a production
environment, take extra care because that user has the `superuser` role and you
could inadvertently make significant changes to the system. You can
alternatively assign the `machine_learning_admin` and `kibana_user` roles to a
user ID of your choice.

For more information, see <<built-in-roles>> and <<privileges-list-cluster>>.

[[ml-gs-data]]
=== Identifying Data for Analysis

For the purposes of this tutorial, we provide sample data that you can play with.
When you consider your own data, however, it's important to take a moment
and consider where the {xpack} {ml} features will be most impactful.

The first consideration is that it must be time series data.
Generally, it's best to use data that is in chronological order. When the data
feed occurs in ascending time order, the statistical models and calculations are
very efficient and occur in real-time.
//TBD: Talk about handling out of sequence data?

The second consideration, especially when you are first learning to use {ml},
is the importance of the data and how familiar you are with it. Ideally, it is
information that contains key performance indicators (KPIs) for the health or
success of your business or system. It is information that you need to act on
when anomalous behavior occurs. You might even have Kibana dashboards that
you're already using to watch this data. The better you know the data,
the quicker you will be able to create {ml} jobs that generate useful insights.

//TBD: Talk about layering additional jobs?
////
 You can then create additional jobs to troubleshoot the situation and put it
into context of what was going on in the system at the time.
The troubleshooting job would not create alarms of its own, but rather would
help explain the overall situation.  It's usually a different job because it's
operating on different indices. Layering jobs is an important concept.
////
////
* Working with out of sequence data:
** In the typical case where data arrives in ascending time order,
each new record pushes the time forward. When a record is received that belongs
to a new bucket, the current bucket is considered to be completed.
At this point, the model is updated and final results are calculated for the
completed bucket and the new bucket is created.
** Expecting data to be in time sequence means that modeling and results
calculations can be performed very efficiently and in real-time.
As a direct consequence of this approach, out-of-sequence records are ignored.
** When data is expected to arrive out-of-sequence, a latency window can be
specified in the job configuration (does not apply to data feeds?). (If we're
using a data feed in the sample, perhaps this discussion can be deferred for
future more-advanced scenario.)
//See http://www.prelert.com/docs/behavioral_analytics/latest/concepts/outofsequence.html
////

The final consideration is where the data is located. If the data that you want
to analyze is stored in Elasticsearch, you can define a _data feed_ that
provides data to the job in real time. When you have both the input data and the
analytical results in Elasticsearch, this data gravity provides performance
benefits.

IMPORTANT: If you want to create {ml} jobs in Kibana, you must use data feeds.
That is to say, you must store your input data in Elasticsearch. When you create
a job, you select an existing index pattern and Kibana configures the data feed
for you under the covers.

If your data is not stored in Elasticsearch, you can create jobs by using
the <<ml-put-job,create job API>> and upload batches of data to the job by
using the <<ml-post-data,post data API>>. That scenario is not covered in
this tutorial, however.

//TBD: The data must be provided in JSON format?

[float]
[[ml-gs-sampledata]]
==== Obtaining a Sample Data Set

The sample data for this tutorial contains information about the requests that
are received by various applications and services in a system. A system
administrator might use this type of information to track the the total
number of requests across all of the infrastructure. If the number of requests
increases or decreases unexpectedly, for example, this might be an indication
that there is a problem or that resources need to be redistributed. By using
the {xpack} {ml} features to model the behavior of this data, it is easier to
identify anomalies and take appropriate action.

* TBD: Provide instructions for downloading the sample data after it's made
available publicly on https://github.com/elastic/examples
//Download this data set by clicking here:
//See  https://download.elastic.co/demos/kibana/gettingstarted/shakespeare.json[shakespeare.json].

Use the following commands to extract the files:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------
tar xvf server_metrics.tar.gz
----------------------------------

Each document in the server-metrics data set has the following schema:

[source,js]
----------------------------------

{
  "index":
  {
    "_index":"server-metrics",
    "_type":"metric",
    "_id":"AVuQL1eekrHQ5a9V5qre"
  }
}
{
  "deny":1783,
  "service":"app_0",
  "@timestamp":"2017-03-26T06:47:28.684926",
  "accept":24465,
  "host":"server_1",
  "total":26248,
  "response":1.8242486553275024
}
----------------------------------

Before you load the data set, you need to set up {ref}/mapping.html[_mappings_]
for the fields. Mappings divide the documents in the index into logical groups
and specify a field's characteristics, such as the field's searchability or
whether or not it's _tokenized_, or broken up into separate words.

The sample data includes an `upload_server-metrics.sh` script, which you can use
to create the mappings and load the data set. Before you run it, however, you
must edit the USERNAME and PASSWORD variables with your actual user ID and
password. If you want to test adding data to an existing data feed, you must
also comment out the final two commands related to `server-metrics_4.json`.

The script runs a command similar
to the following example, which sets up a mapping for the data set:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------

curl -u elastic:elasticpassword -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
http://localhost:9200/server-metrics -d '{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  },
  "mappings": {
      "metric": {
        "properties": {
          "@timestamp": {
            "type": "date"
          },
          "accept": {
            "type": "long"
          },
          "deny": {
            "type": "long"
          },
          "host": {
            "type": "text",
            "fields": {
              "keyword": {
                "type": "keyword",
                "ignore_above": 256
              }
            }
          },
          "response": {
            "type": "float"
          },
          "service": {
            "type": "text",
            "fields": {
              "keyword": {
                "type": "keyword",
                "ignore_above": 256
              }
            }
          },
          "total": {
            "type": "long"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
----------------------------------

NOTE: If you run this command, you must replace `elasticpassword` with your
actual password.

////
This mapping specifies the following qualities for the data set:

* The _@timestamp_ field is a date.
//that uses the ISO format `epoch_second`,
//which is the number of seconds since the epoch.
* The _accept_, _deny_, and _total_ fields are long numbers.
* The _host
////

You can then use the Elasticsearch `bulk` API to load the data set. The
`upload_server-metrics.sh` script runs commands similar to the following
example, which loads three of the JSON files:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------

curl -u elastic:elasticpassword -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"
http://localhost:9200/server-metrics/_bulk --data-binary "@server-metrics_1.json"

curl -u elastic:elasticpassword -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"
http://localhost:9200/server-metrics/_bulk --data-binary "@server-metrics_2.json"

curl -u elastic:elasticpassword -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"
http://localhost:9200/server-metrics/_bulk --data-binary "@server-metrics_3.json"

----------------------------------

//curl -u elastic:elasticpassword -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"
//http://localhost:9200/server-metrics/_bulk --data-binary "@server-metrics_4.json"
These commands might take some time to run, depending on the computing resources
available.

You can verify that the data was loaded successfully with the following command:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------

curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v' -u elastic:elasticpassword
----------------------------------

For three sample JSON files, you should see output similar to the following:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------

health status index ... pri rep docs.count  docs.deleted  store.size ...
green  open   server-metrics ... 1 0 680400  0 101.7mb  ...
----------------------------------

Next, you must define an index pattern for this data set:

. Open Kibana in your web browser and log in. If you are running Kibana
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`.

. Click the **Management** tab, then **Index Patterns**.

. Click the plus sign (+) to define a new index pattern.

. For this tutorial, any pattern that matches the name of the index you've
loaded will work. For example, enter `server-metrics*` as the index pattern.

. Verify that the **Index contains time-based events** is checked.

. Select the `@timestamp` field from the **Time-field name** list.

. Click **Create**.

This data set can now be analyzed in {ml} jobs in Kibana.
//Content based on https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/tutorial-load-dataset.html

[[ml-gs-jobs]]
=== Creating Jobs

Machine learning jobs contain the configuration information and metadata
necessary to perform an analytical task. They also contain the results of the
analytical task.

NOTE: This tutorial uses Kibana to create jobs and view results, but you can
alternatively use APIs to accomplish most tasks.
For API reference information, see <<ml-apis>>.

To work with jobs in Kibana:

. Open Kibana in your web browser and log in. If you are running Kibana
locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`.

. Click **Machine Learning** in the side navigation:
image::images/ml-kibana.jpg["Job Management"]

You can choose to create single metric, multi-metric, or advanced jobs in
Kibana. In this tutorial, the goal is to detect anomalies in the total requests
received by your applications and services. The sample data contains a single
key performance indicator to track this, which is the total requests over time.
It is therefore logical to start by creating a single metric job for this KPI.

[float]
[[ml-gs-job1-create]]
==== Creating a Single Metric Job

A single metric job contains a single _detector_. A detector defines the type of
analysis that will occur (for example, `max`, `average`, or `rare` analytical
functions) and the fields that will be analyzed.

To create a single metric job in Kibana:

. Click **Machine Learning** in the side navigation,
then click **Create new job**.

. Click **Create single metric job**.
image::images/ml-create-jobs.jpg["Create a new job"]

. Click the `server-metrics` index. +
+
--
image::images/ml-gs-index.jpg["Select an index"]
--

. Configure the job by providing the following information:
image::images/ml-gs-single-job.jpg["Create a new job from the server-metrics index"]

.. For the **Aggregation**, select `Sum`. This value specifies the analysis
function that is used.
+
--
Some of the analytical functions look for single anomalous data points. For
example, `max` identifies the maximum value that is seen within a bucket.
Others perform some aggregation over the length of the bucket. For example,
`mean` calculates the mean of all the data points seen within the bucket.
Similarly, `count` calculates the total number of data points within the bucket.
In this tutorial, you are using the `sum` function, which calculates the sum of
the specified field's values within the bucket.
--

.. For the **Field**, select `total`. This value specifies the field that
the detector uses in the function.
+
--
NOTE: Some functions such as `count` and `rare` do not require fields.
--

.. For the **Bucket span**, enter `600s`. This value specifies the size of the
interval that the analysis is aggregated into.
+
--
The {xpack} {ml} features use the concept of a bucket to divide up a continuous
stream of data into batches for processing. For example, if you are monitoring
the total number of requests in the system,
//and receive a data point every 10 minutes
using a bucket span of 1 hour would mean that at the end of each hour, it
calculates the sum of the requests for the last hour and computes the
anomalousness of that value compared to previous hours.

The bucket span has two purposes: it dictates over what time span to look for
anomalous features in data, and also determines how quickly anomalies can be
detected. Choosing a shorter bucket span allows anomalies to be detected more
quickly. However, there is a risk of being too sensitive to natural variations
or noise in the input data. Choosing too long a bucket span can mean that
interesting anomalies are averaged away. There is also the possibility that the
aggregation might smooth out some anomalies based on when the bucket starts
in time.

The bucket span has a significant impact on the analysis. When you're trying to
determine what value to use, take into account the granularity at which you
want to perform the analysis, the frequency of the input data, and the frequency
at which alerting is required.
//TBD: Talk about overlapping buckets? "To avoid this, you can use overlapping
//buckets (how/where?). We analyze the data points in two buckets simultaneously,
//one starting half a bucket span later than the other. Overlapping buckets are
//only beneficial for aggregating functions, and should not be used for
//non-aggregating functions.
--

. Click **Use full transaction_counts data**. A graph is generated,
which represents the total number of requests over time.

. Provide a name for the job, for example `total-requests`. The job name must
be unique in your cluster. You can also optionally provide a description of the
job.

. Click **Create Job**.
image::images/ml-gs-job1.jpg["A graph of the total number of requests over time"]

As the job is created, the graph is updated to give a visual representation of
the {ml} that occurs as the data is processed.
//To explore the results, click **View Results**.
//TBD: image::images/ml-gs-job1-results.jpg["The total-requests job is created"]

TIP: The `create_single_metic.sh` script creates a similar job and data feed by
using the {ml} APIs. For API reference information, see <<ml-apis>>.

[[ml-gs-job1-manage]]
=== Managing Jobs

After you create a job, you can see its status in the **Job Management** tab:

image::images/ml-gs-job1-manage.jpg["Status information for the total-requests job"]

The following information is provided for each job:

Job ID::
The unique identifier for the job.

Description::
The optional description of the job.

Processed records::
The number of records that have been processed by the job.

NOTE: Depending on how you send data to the job, the number of processed
records is not always equal to the number of input records. For more information,
see the `processed_record_count` description in <<ml-datacounts,Data Counts Objects>>.

Memory status::
The status of the mathematical models. When you create jobs by using the APIs or
by using the advanced options in Kibana, you can specify a `model_memory_limit`.
That value is the maximum amount of memory, in MiB, that the mathematical models
can use. Once that limit is approached, data pruning becomes more aggressive.
Upon exceeding that limit, new entities are not modeled.
The default value is `4096`. The memory status field reflects whether you have
reached or exceeded the model memory limit. It can have one of the following
values: +
`ok`::: The models stayed below the configured value.
`soft_limit`::: The models used more than 60% of the configured memory limit
and older unused models will be pruned to free up space.
`hard_limit`::: The models used more space than the configured memory limit.
As a result, not all incoming data was processed.

Job state::
The status of the job, which can be one of the following values: +
`open`::: The job is available to receive and process data.
`closed`::: The job finished successfully with its model state persisted.
The job must be opened before it can accept further data.
`closing`::: The job close action is in progress and has not yet completed.
A closing job cannot accept further data.
`failed`::: The job did not finish successfully due to an error.
This situation can occur due to invalid input data.
If the job had irrevocably failed, it must be force closed and then deleted.
If the data feed can be corrected, the job can be closed and then re-opened.

Datafeed state::
The status of the data feed, which can be one of the following values: +
started::: The data feed is actively receiving data.
stopped::: The data feed is stopped and will not receive data until it is re-started.
//TBD: How to restart data feeds in Kibana?

Latest timestamp::
The timestamp of the last processed record.
//TBD: Is that right?

If you click the arrow beside the name of job, you can show or hide additional
information, such as the settings, configuration information, or messages for
the job.

You can also click one of the **Actions** buttons to start the data feed, edit
the job or data feed, and clone or delete the job, for example.

[float]
[[ml-gs-job1-datafeed]]
==== Managing Data Feeds

A data feed can be started and stopped multiple times throughout its lifecycle.
If you want to retrieve more data from Elasticsearch and the data feed is
stopped, you must restart it.

For example, if you only loaded three of the sample JSON files, you can now load
the fourth using the Elasticsearch `bulk` API as follows:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------

curl -u elastic:elasticpassword -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"
http://localhost:9200/server-metrics/_bulk --data-binary "@server-metrics_4.json"
----------------------------------

You can optionally verify that the data was loaded successfully with the
following command:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------

curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v' -u elastic:elasticpassword
----------------------------------

For the four sample JSON files, you should see output similar to the following:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------

health status index ... pri rep docs.count  docs.deleted  store.size ...
green  open   server-metrics ... 1 0 907200  0  136.2mb  ...
----------------------------------

To use this new data in your job:

. In the **Machine Learning** / **Job Management** tab, click the following
button to start the data feed: image::images/ml-start-feed.jpg["Start data feed"].

. Choose a start time and end time. For example,
click **Continue from 2017-04-22** and **No end time**, then click **Start**.
image::images/ml-gs-job1-datafeed.jpg["Restarting a data feed"]

* TBD: Why do I not see increases in the job count stats after this occurs?
How can I determine that it has been successfully processed?


[[ml-gs-jobresults]]
=== Exploring Job Results

The {xpack} {ml} features analyze the input stream of data, model its behavior,
and perform analysis based on the detectors you defined in your job. When an
event occurs outside of the model, that event is identified as an anomaly.

Result records for each anomaly are stored in `.ml-notifications` and
`.ml-anomalies*` indices in Elasticsearch. By default, the name of the
index where {ml} results are stored is `shared`, which corresponds to
the `.ml-anomalies-shared` index.
//For example, these results include the probability of detecting that anomaly.

You can use the **Anomaly Explorer** or the
**Single Metric Viewer** in Kibana to view the analysis results.

Anomaly Explorer::
  This view contains heatmap charts, where the color for each section of the
  timeline is determined by the maximum anomaly score in that period.
//TBD: Do the time periods in the heat map correspond to buckets?

Single Metric Viewer::
  This view contains a time series chart that represents the analysis.
  As in the **Anomaly Explorer**, anomalous data points are shown in
  different colors depending on their probability.

[float]
[[ml-gs-job1-analyze]]
==== Exploring Single Metric Job Results

By default when you view the results for a single metric job,
the **Single Metric Viewer** opens:
image::images/ml-gs-job1-analysis.jpg["Single Metric Viewer for total-requests job"]

The blue line in the chart represents the actual data values. The shaded blue area
represents the expected behavior that was calculated by the model.
//TBD: What is meant by "95% prediction bounds"?

If you slide the time selector from the beginning of the data to the end of the
data, you can see how the model improves as it processes more data. At the
beginning, the expected range of values is pretty broad and the model is not
capturing the periodicity in the data. But it quickly learns and begins to
reflect the daily variation.

Any data points outside the range that was predicted by the model are marked
as anomalies. When you have high volumes of real-life data, many anomalies
might be found. These vary in probability from very likely to highly unlikely,
that is to say, from not particularly anomalous to highly anomalous. There
can be none, one or two or tens, sometimes hundreds of anomalies found within
each bucket. There can be many thousands found per job. In order to provide
a sensible view of the results, an _anomaly score_ is calculated for each bucket
time interval. The anomaly score is a value from 0 to 100, which indicates
the significance of the observed anomaly compared to previously seen anomalies.
The highly anomalous values are shown in red and the low scored values are
indicated in blue. An interval with a high anomaly score is significant and
requires investigation.

Slide the time selector to a section of the time series that contains a red data
point. If you hover over the point, you can see more information about that
data point. You can also see details in the **Anomalies** section of the viewer.
For example:

image::images/ml-gs-job1-anomalies.jpg["Single Metric Viewer Anomalies for total-requests job"]

For each anomaly you can see key details such as the time, the actual and
expected ("typical") values, and their probability.

You can see the same information in a different format by using the **Anomaly Explorer**:

image::images/ml-gs-job1-explorer.jpg["Anomaly Explorer for total-requests job"]

Click one of the red areas in the heatmap to see details about that anomaly. For
example:

image::images/ml-gs-job1-explorer-anomaly.jpg["Anomaly Explorer details for total-requests job"]

After you have identified anomalies, often the next step is to try to determine
the context of those situations. For example, are there other factors that are
contributing to the problem? Are the anomalies confined to particular
applications or servers? You can begin to troubleshoot these situations by
layering additional jobs or creating multi-metric jobs.

////
[float]
[[ml-gs-job2-create]]
==== Creating a Multi-Metric Job

TBD.

* Walk through creation of a simple multi-metric job.
* Provide overview of:
** partition fields,
** influencers
*** An influencer is someone or something that has influenced or contributed to the anomaly.
Results are aggregated for each influencer, for each bucket, across all detectors.
In this way, a combined anomaly score is calculated for each influencer,
which determines its relative anomalousness. You can specify one or many influencers.
Picking an influencer is strongly recommended for the following reasons:
**** It allow you to blame someone/something for the anomaly
**** It simplifies and aggregates results
*** The best influencer is the person or thing that you want to blame for the anomaly.
In many cases, users or client IP make excellent influencers.
*** By/over/partition fields are usually good candidates for influencers.
*** Influencers can be any field in the source data; they do not need to be fields
specified in detectors, although they often are.
** by/over fields,
*** detectors
**** You can have more than one detector in a job which is more efficient than
running multiple jobs against the same data stream.

[[ml-gs-job2-analyze]]
===== Viewing Multi-Metric Job Results

TBD.

* Walk through exploration of job results.
* Describe how influencer detection accelerates root cause identification.

////
////
* Provide brief overview of statistical models and/or link to more info.
* Possibly discuss effect of altering bucket span.

The anomaly score is a sophisticated aggregation of the anomaly records in the
bucket. The calculation is optimized for high throughput, gracefully ages
historical data, and reduces the signal to noise levels. It adjusts for
variations in event rate, takes into account the frequency and the level of
anomalous activity and is adjusted relative to past anomalous behavior.
In addition, [the anomaly score] is boosted if anomalous activity occurs for related entities,
for example if disk IO and CPU are both behaving unusually for a given host.
** Once an anomalous time interval has been identified, it can be expanded to
view the detailed anomaly records which are the significant causal factors.
