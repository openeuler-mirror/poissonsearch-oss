=== Jobs

Machine learning jobs contain the configuration information and metadata
necessary to perform an analytics task. For a list of the properties associated
with a job, see {ref}/ml-job-resource.html[Job Resources].

[[ml-detectors]]
=== Detectors

As part of the configuration information that is associated with a job,
detectors define the type of analysis that needs to be done. They also specify
which fields to analyze. You can have more than one detector in a job, which
is more efficient than running multiple jobs against the same data. For a list
of the properties associated with detectors, see
{ref}/ml-job-resource.html#ml-detectorconfig[Detector Configuration Objects].
