=== Sum Functions

The {xpackml} features include the following sum functions:

* `sum`, `high_sum`, `low_sum`
* `non_null_sum`, `high_non_null_sum`, `low_non_null_sum`

The sum functions detect anomalies when the sum of a field in a bucket is anomalous.

Use high-sided functions if you want to monitor unusually high totals.

Use low-sided functions if want to look at drops in totals.

Use `non_null_sum` functions if your data is sparse. Buckets without values will
be ignored; buckets with a zero value will be analyzed.

NOTE: Input data can contain pre-calculated fields that give the total count of some value.  For
example, transactions per minute.

TBD: Incorporate from prelert docs?:
Ensure you are familiar with our advice on Summarization of Input Data, as this is likely to provide
a more appropriate method to using the sum function.
