=== Information Content Functions

The {xpackml} features include the following information content functions:

* `info_content`, `high_info_content`, `low_info_content`

The information content functions detect anomalies in the amount of information
that is contained in strings within a bucket. These functions can be used as
a more sophisticated method to identify incidences of data exfiltration or
C2C activity, when analyzing the size in bytes of the data might not be sufficient.

If you want to monitor for unusually high amounts of information, use `high_info_content`.
If want to look at drops in information content, use `low_info_content`.
