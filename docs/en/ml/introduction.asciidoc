== Introduction

Machine learning in {xpack} automates the analysis of time-series data by
creating accurate baselines of normal behaviors in the data, and identifying
anomalous patterns in that data.

Driven by proprietary machine learning algorithms, anomalies related to temporal
deviations in values/counts/frequencies, statistical rarity, and unusual
behaviors for a member of a population are detected, scored and linked with
statistically significant influencers in the data.

Automated periodicity detection and quick adaptation to changing data ensure
that you donâ€™t need to specify algorithms, models, or other data
science-related configurations in order to get the benefits of {ml}.

=== Integration with the Elastic Stack

Machine learning is tightly integrated with the Elastic Stack.
Data is pulled from {es} for analysis and anomaly results are displayed in
{kb} dashboards.
