{monitoring} enables you to easily monitor the health of your {es} cluster. The
monitoring metrics are collected from each node and stored in {es} indices. You
can then view the data from {kib} where itâ€™s easy to spot issues at a glance or
delve into the system behavior over time to diagnose operational issues. In
addition to the built-in status warnings, you can also set up custom alerts
based on the data in the monitoring indices.

This section focuses on the {es} monitoring infrastructure and setup. For an
introduction to monitoring your Elastic stack, including Logstash and {kib}, see
{xpack-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the Elastic Stack].
//For information about using the Monitoring UI, see Monitoring in the Kibana guide.
