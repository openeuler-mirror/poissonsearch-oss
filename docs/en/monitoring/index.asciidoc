{monitoring} enables you to easily monitor the health of your {es} cluster. The
monitoring metrics are collected from each node and stored in {es} indices.

Each {es} node is considered unique based on its persistent UUID, which is
written on first start to its <<path-settings,`path.data`>> directory, which
defaults to `./data`.

You can view the monitoring data from {kib} where itâ€™s easy to spot issues at a
glance or delve into the system behavior over time to diagnose operational
issues. In addition to the built-in status warnings, you can also set up custom
alerts based on the data in the monitoring indices.

This section focuses on the {es} monitoring infrastructure and setup. For an
introduction to monitoring your Elastic stack, including Logstash and {kib}, see
{xpack-ref}/xpack-monitoring.html[Monitoring the Elastic Stack].
