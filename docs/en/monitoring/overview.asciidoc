{es} is at the core of the {monitoring}. In all cases, {monitoring} documents
are just ordinary JSON documents built by monitoring each Elastic Stack
component at some collection interval (`10s` by default), then indexing those
documents into the monitoring cluster. Each component in the stack is
responsible for monitoring itself and then forwarding those documents to {es}
for both routing and indexing (storage).

For {es}, this process is handled by what are called
<<es-monitoring-collectors,collectors>> and
<<es-monitoring-exporters,exporters>>. In the past, collectors and exporters
were considered to be part of a monitoring "agent", but that term is generally
not used anymore.

All settings associated with {monitoring} in {es} must be set in either the
`elasticsearch.yml` file for each node or, where possible, in the dynamic
cluster settings. For more information, see <<monitoring-settings>>.
