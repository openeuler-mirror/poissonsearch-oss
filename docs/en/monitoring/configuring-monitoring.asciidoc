By default, {monitoring} is enabled but data collection is disabled. Advanced
monitoring settings enable you to control how frequently data is collected,
configure timeouts, and set the retention period for locally-stored monitoring
indices. You can also adjust how monitoring data is displayed. For more
information, see <<es-monitoring>>.
