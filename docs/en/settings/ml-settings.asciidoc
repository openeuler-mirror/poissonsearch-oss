=== General Machine Learning Settings

`xpack.ml.enabled`::
Set to `true` (default) to enable {ml}. +
+
If set to `false` in `elasticsearch.yml`, the {ml} APIs are disabled.
You also cannot open jobs, start {dfeeds}, or receive transport (internal)
communication requests related to {ml} APIs.
If set to `false` in `kibana.yml`, the {ml} icon is not visible in {kib}. +
+
IMPORTANT: If you want to use {ml} features in your cluster, you must have
`xpack.ml.enabled` set to `true` on all master-eligible nodes. This is the
default behavior.

`node.ml`::
Set to `true` (default) to identify the node as a _machine learning node_. +
+
If set to `false` in `elasticsearch.yml`, the node cannot run jobs. If set to
`true` but `xpack.ml.enabled` is set to `false`, the `node.ml` setting is
ignored and the node cannot run jobs. If you want to run jobs, there must be at
least one machine learning node in your cluster. +
+
IMPORTANT: On dedicated coordinating nodes or dedicated master nodes, disable
the `node.ml` role.
