==== Start Data Feeds

A data feed must be started in order for it to be ready to receive and analyze data.
A data feed can be opened and closed multiple times throughout its lifecycle.

===== Request

`POST _xpack/ml/datafeeds/<feed_id>/_start`

////
===== Description

A job must be open in order to it to accept and analyze data.

When you open a new job, it starts with an empty model.

When you open an existing job, the most recent model state is automatically loaded.
The job is ready to resume its analysis from where it left off, once new data is received.
