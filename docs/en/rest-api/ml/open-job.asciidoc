==== Open Jobs

A job must be opened in order for it to be ready to receive and analyze data.
A job can be opened and closed multiple times throughout its lifecycle.

===== Request

`POST _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/{job_id}/_open`

===== Description

A job must be open in order to it to accept and analyze data.

When you open a new job, it starts with an empty model.

When you open an existing job, the most recent model state is automatically loaded.
The job is ready to resume its analysis from where it left off, once new data is received.

You must have `manage_ml`, or `manage` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see <<privileges-list-cluster>>.

===== Path Parameters

`job_id` (required)::
(string) Identifier for the job

===== Request Body

`open_timeout`::
  (time) Controls the time to wait until a job has opened.
  The default value is 30 minutes.

`ignore_downtime`::
  (boolean) If true (default), any gap in data since it was
  last closed is treated as a maintenance window. That is to say, it is not an anomaly
