==== Model Snapshot Resources

////
Model snapshots are saved to disk periodically.
By default, this is occurs approximately every 3 hours.
//TBD: Can you change this setting?

By default, model snapshots are retained for one day. You can change this
behavior with by updating the `model_snapshot_retention_days` for the job.
When choosing a new value, consider the following:

* Persistence enables resilience in the event of a system failure.
* Persistence allows for snapshots to be reverted.
* The time taken to persist a job is proportional to the size of the model in memory.
//* The smallest allowed value is 3600 (1 hour).

A model snapshot resource has the following properties:

`description`::
  (string) An optional description of the job.

`job_id`::
  (string) A numerical character string that uniquely identifies the job.

`latest_record_time_stamp`::
  () TBD. For example: 1455232663000.

`latest_result_time_stamp`::
  () TBD. For example: 1455229800000.

`model_size_stats`::
  (object) TBD. See <<ml-snapshot-stats,Model Size Statistics>>.

`retain`::
  (boolean) TBD. For example: false.

`snapshot_id`::
  (string) A numerical character string that uniquely identifies the model
  snapshot. For example: "1491852978".

`snapshot_doc_count`::
  () TBD. For example: 1.

`timestamp`::
  (date) The creation timestamp for the snapshot, specified in ISO 8601 format.
  For example: 1491852978000.
