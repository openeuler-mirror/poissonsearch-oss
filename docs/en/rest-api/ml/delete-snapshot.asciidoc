==== Delete Model Snapshots

The delete model snapshot API enables you to delete an existing model snapshot.

===== Request

===== Description

IMPORTANT: You cannot delete the active model snapshot. To delete that snapshot,
first revert to a different one.

//is "...the snapshot with the highest restorePriority".

===== Path Parameters

`job_id` (required)::
  (string) Identifier for the job

  (string) Identifier for the model snapshot
