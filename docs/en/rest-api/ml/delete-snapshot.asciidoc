==== Delete Model Snapshots

The delete model snapshot API enables you to delete an existing model snapshot.

===== Request

`DELETE _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/model_snapshots/<snapshot_id>`


===== Description

IMPORTANT: You cannot delete the active model snapshot. To delete that snapshot,
first revert to a different one.

You must have `manage_ml`, or `manage` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see <<privileges-list-cluster>>.

//TBD: Where do you see restorePriority? Per old docs, the active model snapshot
//is "...the snapshot with the highest restorePriority".

===== Path Parameters

`job_id` (required)::
  (string) Identifier for the job

`snapshot_id` (required)::
  (string) Identifier for the model snapshot
