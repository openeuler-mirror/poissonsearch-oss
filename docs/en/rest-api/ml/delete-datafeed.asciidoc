[[ml-delete-datafeed]]
==== Delete Data Feeds

The delete data feed API allows you to delete an existing data feed.

===== Request

`DELETE _xpack/ml/datafeeds/<feed_id>`

////
===== Description

All job configuration, model state and results are deleted.

IMPORTANT:  Deleting a job must be done via this API only. Do not delete the
            job directly from the `.ml-*` indices using the Elasticsearch
            DELETE Document API. When {security} is enabled, make sure no `write`
            privileges are granted to anyone over the `.ml-*` indices.

Before you can delete a job, you must delete the data feeds that are associated with it.
//See <<>>.

It is not currently possible to delete multiple jobs using wildcards or a comma separated list.
////
===== Path Parameters

`feed_id` (required)::
  (+string+)    Identifier for the data feed
