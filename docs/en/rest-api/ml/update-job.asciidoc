==== Update Jobs

The update job API enables you to update certain properties of a job.

===== Request

`POST _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/_update`


////
===== Description

//TBD: Important:: Updates do not take effect until after then job is closed and re-opened.
////
===== Path Parameters

`job_id` (required)::
  (string) Identifier for the job

===== Request Body

The following properties can be updated after the job is created:

`analysis_config`::
  (object) The analysis configuration, which specifies how to analyze the data.
  See <<ml-analysisconfig, analysis configuration objects>>. In particular,
  the following properties can be updated: `categorization_filters`,
  `detector_description`.
//TBD: Full list of properties that can be updated?  

`analysis_limits`::
  (object) Specifies runtime limits for the job.
  See <<ml-apilimits,analysis limits>>.

[NOTE]
--
* You can update the `analysis_limits` only while the job is closed.
* The `model_memory_limit` property value cannot be decreased.
* If the `memory_status` property in the `model_size_stats` object has a value
of `hard_limit`, this means that it was unable to process some data. You might
want to re-run this job with an increased `model_memory_limit`.
--

`description`::
  (string) An optional description of the job.


===== Authorization

You must have `manage_ml`, or `manage` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see <<privileges-list-cluster>>.


===== Examples

The following example updates the `it-ops-kpi` job:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/it-ops-kpi/_update
{
    "description":"New description",
    "analysis_limits":{
      "model_memory_limit": 8192
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[skip:todo]

When the job is updated, you receive the following results:
[source,js]
----
{
  "job_id": "it-ops-kpi",
  "job_type": "anomaly_detector",
  "description": "New description",
  ...
  "analysis_limits": {
    "model_memory_limit": 8192
  },
  ...
}
