[[ml-delete-job]]
==== Delete Jobs

The delete job API allows you to delete an existing anomaly detection job.

===== Request

`DELETE _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>`

===== Description

All job configuration, model state and results are deleted.

IMPORTANT:  Deleting a job must be done via this API only. Do not delete the
            job directly from the `.ml-*` indices using the Elasticsearch
            DELETE Document API. When {security} is enabled, make sure no `write`
            privileges are granted to anyone over the `.ml-*` indices.

Before you can delete a job, you must delete the data feeds that are associated with it.
See <<ml-delete-datafeed,Delete Data Feeds>>.

It is not currently possible to delete multiple jobs using wildcards or a comma separated list.

===== Path Parameters

`job_id` (required)::
  (string)    Identifier for the job

////
