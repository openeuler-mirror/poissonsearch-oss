[[ml-delete-job]]
=== Delete Jobs

The delete job API enables you to delete an existing anomaly detection job.


==== Request

`DELETE _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>`


==== Description

All job configuration, model state and results are deleted.

IMPORTANT:  Deleting a job must be done via this API only. Do not delete the
            job directly from the `.ml-*` indices using the Elasticsearch
            DELETE Document API. When {security} is enabled, make sure no `write`
            privileges are granted to anyone over the `.ml-*` indices.

Before you can delete a job, you must delete the {dfeeds} that are associated
with it. See <<ml-delete-datafeed,Delete {dfeeds-cap}>>. Unless the `force` parameter
is used the job must be closed before it can be deleted.

It is not currently possible to delete multiple jobs using wildcards or a comma
separated list.

==== Path Parameters

`job_id` (required)::
  (string) Identifier for the job

===== Query Parameters

`force`::
  (boolean) Use to forcefully delete an opened job; this method is quicker than
  closing and deleting the job.


==== Authorization

You must have `manage_ml`, or `manage` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see <<privileges-list-cluster>>.


==== Examples

The following example deletes the `event_rate` job:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/event_rate
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[skip:todo]

When the job is deleted, you receive the following results:
[source,js]
----
{
  "acknowledged": true
}
