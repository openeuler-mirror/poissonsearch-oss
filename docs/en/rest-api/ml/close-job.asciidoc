[[ml-close-job]]
==== Close Jobs

An anomaly detection job must be opened in order for it to be ready to receive and analyze data.
A job may be opened and closed multiple times throughout its lifecycle.

===== Request

`POST _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/_close`

===== Description

A job can be closed once all data has been analyzed.

When you close a job, it runs housekeeping tasks such as pruning the model history,
flushing buffers, calculating final results and persisting the internal models.
Depending upon the size of the job, it could take several minutes to close and
the equivalent time to re-open.

Once closed, the anomaly detection job has almost no overhead on the cluster
(except for maintaining its meta data). A closed job is blocked for receiving
data and analysis operations, however you can still explore and navigate results.

//NOTE:
//OUTDATED?: If using the {prelert} UI, the job will be automatically closed when stopping a datafeed job.

===== Path Parameters

`job_id` (required)::
  (+string+)    Identifier for the job

===== Query Parameters

`close_timeout`::
  (+time+) Controls the time to wait until a job has closed.
  The default value is 30 minutes.

===== Examples

The following example closes the `event_rate` job:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/event_rate/_close
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[skip:todo]

When the job is closed, you receive the following results:
----
{
  "closed": true
}
