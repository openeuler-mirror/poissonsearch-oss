===== Examples

The following example gets influencer information for the `it_ops_new_kpi` job:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/it_ops_new_kpi/results/influencers
{
  "sort": "influencer_score",
  "desc": true
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[skip:todo]

In this example, the API returns the following information, sorted based on the
influencer score in descending order:
