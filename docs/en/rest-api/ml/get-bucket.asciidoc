==== Get Buckets

The get bucket API enables you to retrieve information about buckets in the
results from a job.

===== Request

`GET _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/results/buckets` +

`GET _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/results/buckets/<timestamp>`

===== Description

This API presents a chronological view of the records, grouped by bucket.

You must have `monitor_ml`, `monitor`, `manage_ml`, or `manage` cluster
privileges to use this API. You also need `read` index privilege on the index
that stores the results. The `machine_learning_admin` and `machine_learning_user`
roles provide these privileges. For more information, see
<<security-privileges>> and <<built-in-roles>>.

===== Path Parameters

`job_id`::
  (string) Identifier for the job

`timestamp`::
  (string) The timestamp of a single bucket result.
  If you do not specify this optional parameter, the API returns information
  about all buckets.

===== Request Body

`anomaly_score`::
  (double) Returns buckets with anomaly scores higher than this value.

`end`::
  (string) Returns buckets with timestamps earlier than this time.

`expand`::
  (boolean) If true, the output includes anomaly records.

`from`::
  (integer) Skips the specified number of buckets.

`include_interim`::
  (boolean) If true, the output includes interim results.

`size`::
  (integer) Specifies the maximum number of buckets to obtain.

`start`::
  (string) Returns buckets with timestamps after this time.

===== Results

The API returns the following information:

`buckets`::
  (array) An array of bucket objects. For more information, see
  <<ml-results-buckets,Buckets>>.

===== Responses

200
(EmptyResponse) The cluster has been successfully deleted
404
(BasicFailedReply) The cluster specified by {cluster_id} cannot be found (code: clusters.cluster_not_found)
412
(BasicFailedReply) The Elasticsearch cluster has not been shutdown yet (code: clusters.cluster_plan_state_error)
////
===== Examples

The following example gets bucket information for the `it-ops-kpi` job:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/it-ops-kpi/results/buckets
{
  "anomaly_score": 80,
  "start": "1454530200001"
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[skip:todo]

In this example, the API returns a single result that matches the specified
score and time constraints:

  "buckets": [
    {
      "job_id": "it-ops-kpi",
