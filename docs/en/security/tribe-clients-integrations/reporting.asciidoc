=== Reporting and Security

Reporting operates by creating and updating documents in Elasticsearch in
response to user actions in Kibana.

To use Reporting with {security} enabled, you need to <<kibana, set up Kibana
to work with {security}>>. If you are automatically generating reports with
<<xpack-alerting, {watcher}>>, you also need to configure {watcher} to trust the
Kibana server's certificate. For more information, see {kibana-ref}/securing-reporting.html[Securing Reporting].

[[reporting-app-users]]
To enable users to generate reports, assign them the built in `reporting_user`
and `kibana_user` roles:

* If you're using the `native` realm, you can assign roles through
**Management / Users** UI in Kibana or with the `user` API. For example,
the following request creates a `reporter` user that has the
`reporting_user` and `kibana_user` roles:
+
[source, sh]
---------------------------------------------------------------
POST /_xpack/security/user/reporter
{
  "password" : "changeme",
  "roles" : ["kibana_user", "reporting_user"],
  "full_name" : "Reporting User"
}
---------------------------------------------------------------

* If you are using an LDAP or Active Directory realm, you can either assign
roles on a per user basis, or assign roles to groups of users. By default, role
mappings are configured in <<mapping-roles, `config/shield/role_mapping.yml`>>.
For example, the following snippet assigns the user named Bill Murray the
`kibana_user` and `reporting_user` roles:
+
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kibana_user:
  - "cn=Bill Murray,dc=example,dc=com"
reporting_user:
  - "cn=Bill Murray,dc=example,dc=com"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
