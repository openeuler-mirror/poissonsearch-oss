== Tribe, Clients and Integrations

When using a {ref}/modules-tribe.html[Tribe Nodes] you need to take extra steps to secure its communication
with the connected clusters

* <<tribe-node-configuring, Tribe Node Security>>

You will need to update the configuration for several clients to work with a
secured cluster:

* <<java-clients, Java Clients>>
* <<http-clients, HTTP Clients>>


{security} enables you to secure you Elasticsearch cluster. But Elasticsearch
itself is only one product within the Elastic Stack. It is often the case that
other products in the stack are connected to the cluster and therefore need to
be secured as well, or at least communicate with the cluster in a secured way:

* <<hadoop, Apache Hadoop>>
* <<logstash, Logstash>>
* <<kibana, Kibana>>
* <<secure-monitoring, Monitoring>>
