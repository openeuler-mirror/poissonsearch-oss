=== Logging changes

[discrete]
==== Loggers under `org.elasticsearch.action` now log at `INFO` level by default

The default log level for most loggers is `INFO`, but in earlier versions
loggers in the `org.elasticsearch.action.*` hierarchy emitted log messages at
`DEBUG` level by default. This sometimes resulted in a good deal of unnecessary
log noise. From 7.7 onwards the default log level for logger in this hierarchy
is now `INFO`, in line with most other loggers. If needed, you can recover the
pre-7.7 default behaviour by adjusting your <<logging>>.

[[deprecate-missing-realm-order]]
==== Authentication realm `order` will be a required config in version 8.0.0.

The `order` config will be required in version 8.0.0 for authentication realm
configuration of any type. If the `order` config is missing for a realm, the node
will fail to start.

[discrete]
[[deprecate-duplicated-realm-orders]]
==== Authentication realm `order` uniqueness will be enforced in version 8.0.0.

The `order` config of authentication realms must be unique in version 8.0.0.
If you configure more than one realm of any type with the same order, the node will fail to start.
