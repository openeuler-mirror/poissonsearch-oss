=== Logging changes

[discrete]
==== Loggers under `org.elasticsearch.action` now log at `INFO` level by default

The default log level for most loggers is `INFO`, but in earlier versions
loggers in the `org.elasticsearch.action.*` hierarchy emitted log messages at
`DEBUG` level by default. This sometimes resulted in a good deal of unnecessary
log noise. From 7.7 onwards the default log level for logger in this hierarchy
is now `INFO`, in line with most other loggers. If needed, you can recover the
pre-7.7 default behaviour by adjusting your <<logging>>.
