[[breaking_78_api_changes]]
=== API changes

[discrete]
==== Deprecation of `local` parameter for get field mapping API

The `local` parameter is a no-op and field mappings are always retrieved locally.
As of 7.8, this parameter is deprecated and will be removed in next major version.

=== Mappings changes

[discrete]
[[prevent-enabled-setting-change]]
==== `enabled` setting cannot be changed on root mapper

Previously, Elasticsearch accepted mapping updates that tried to change the
`enabled` setting on the root mapping. The update was not applied, but the
request didn't throw an error. As of 7.8, requests that attempt to change
`enabled` on the root mapping will fail.

[discrete]
[[prevent-include-in-root-change]]
==== `include_in_root` and `include_in_parent` cannot be changed

Elasticsearch previously accepted mapping updates that changed the
`include_in_root` and `include_in_parent` settings. The update was not
applied, but the request didn't throw an error. As of 7.8, requests that
attempt to change these settings will fail.
