*Details* +
Mapping requests that attempt to change the {ref}/enabled.html[`enabled`]
mapping parameter for a root mapping will fail and return an error.

Previously, {es} accepted mapping requests that attempted to change the
`enabled` parameter of the root mapping. Theses changes were not applied, but
such requests didn't return an error.

{ref}/nested.html#nested-include-in-root-parm[`include_in_root`] mapping
parameter for a `nested` field will fail and return an error.

Previously, {es} accepted mapping requests that attempted to change the
`include_in_parent` or `include_in_root` parameter. Theses changes were not

locally.

[[builtin-users-changes]]
==== Changes to built-in users

[float]
===== The `kibana` user has been deprecated in favor of the `kibana_system` user

The `kibana` user was historically used to authenticate {kib} to {es}.
The name of this user was confusing, and was often mistakenly used to login to {kib}.
This has been renamed to `kibana_system` in order to reduce confusion, and to better
align with other built-in system accounts.

If your `kibana.yml` used to contain:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.username: kibana
--------------------------------------------------

then you should update to use the new `kibana_system` user instead:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.username: kibana_system
--------------------------------------------------


[float]
[[builtin-roles-changes]]
==== Changes to built-in roles

[float]
===== The `kibana_user` role has been deprecated in favor of the `kibana_admin` role

Users who were previously assigned the `kibana_user` role should instead be assigned
the `kibana_admin` role. This role grants the same set of privileges as `kibana_user`, but has been
renamed to better reflect its intended use.
