[[breaking_73_mapping_changes]]
=== Mapping changes

[float]
==== Defining multi-fields within multi-fields

Previously, it was possible to define a multi-field within a multi-field.
Defining chained multi-fields is now deprecated and will no longer be supported
in 8.0. To resolve the issue, all instances of `fields` that occur within a
`fields` block should be removed from the mappings, either by flattening the
chained `fields` blocks into a single level, or by switching to `copy_to` if
appropriate.

[[breaking_73_plugin_changes]]
=== Plugins changes

[float]
==== IndexStorePlugin changes

IndexStore and DirectoryService have been replaced by a stateless and simple
DirectoryFactory interface to create custom Lucene directory instances per shard.
