[[breaking_74_plugin_changes]]
=== Plugins changes

[float]
==== TokenizerFactory changes

TokenizerFactory now has a `name()` method that must be implemented.  Most
plugin-provided TokenizerFactory implementations will extend `AbstractTokenizerFactory`,
which now takes a `name` parameter in its constructor.

=== Search Changes

[float]
==== Forbid empty doc values in vector functions
If a document doesn't have a value for a vector field (dense_vector
or sparse_vector) on which a vector function is executed, an error will
be thrown.

[[breaking_74_snapshots_changes]]
=== Snapshot and Restore changes

[float]
==== The S3 repository plugin uses the DNS style access pattern by default

Starting in version 7.4 the `repository-s3` plugin does not use the
now-deprecated path-style access pattern by default. In versions 7.0, 7.1, 7.2
and 7.3 the `repository-s3` plugin always used the path-style access pattern.
This is a breaking change for deployments that only support path-style access
but which are recognized as supporting DNS-style access by the AWS SDK. If your
deployment only supports path-style access and is affected by this change then
you must configure the S3 client setting `path_style_access` to `true`. This
breaking change was made necessary by
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/[AWS's
announcement] that the path-style access pattern is deprecated and will be
unsupported on buckets created after September 30th 2020.
