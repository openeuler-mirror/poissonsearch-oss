=== {transforms-cap}

We introduced {transforms} in 7.2.0 as a beta feature. It is now mature enough
to declare the feature GA (general availability). {transforms-cap} enable you to
pivot and summarize your data and store it in a new index. See
{ref}/transforms.html[{transforms-cap}] and
{ref}//transform-apis.html[{transform-cap} APIs].
