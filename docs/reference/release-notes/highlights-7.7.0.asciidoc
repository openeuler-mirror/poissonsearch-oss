=== Fixed index corruption on shrunk indices

Applying deletes or updates on an index after it had been shrunk would likely
corrupt the index. We advise users of Elasticsearch 6.x who opt in for soft
deletes on some of their indices and all users of Elasticsearch 7.x to upgrade
to 7.7 as soon as possible to no longer be subject to this corruption bug. In
case upgrading in the near future is not an option, we recommend to completely
stop using `_shrink` on read-write indices and to do a force-merge right after
shrinking on read-only indices, which significantly reduces the likeliness of
being affected by this bug in case deletes or updates get applied by mistake.
This bug is fixed as of {es} 7.7.0. Low-level details can be found on the
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9300[corresponding issue].

=== {transforms-cap}

We introduced {transforms} in 7.2.0 as a beta feature. It is now mature enough
to declare the feature GA (general availability). {transforms-cap} enable you to
pivot and summarize your data and store it in a new index. See
{ref}/transforms.html[{transforms-cap}] and
{ref}//transform-apis.html[{transform-cap} APIs].
