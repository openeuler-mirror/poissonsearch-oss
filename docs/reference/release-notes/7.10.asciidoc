=== Stats changes

Estimates removed from filesystem stats::
* {es} would sometimes report the data path which it estimated to have the
  most and least available space in the filesystem stats. These stats were
  often very out of date and were frequently omitted from responses to the
  stats APIs. They are now always omitted. {es-pull}59755[#59755]
