=== Ingest Attachment Processor Plugin

The ingest attachment plugin lets Elasticsearch extract file attachments in common formats (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF) by
using the Apache text extraction library http://lucene.apache.org/tika/[Tika].

You can use the ingest attachment plugin as a replacement for the mapper attachment plugin.

The source field must be a base64 encoded binary.

NOTE: Extracting contents from binary data is a resource intensive operation and
      consumes a lot of resources. It is highly recommended to run pipelines
      using this processor in a dedicated ingest node.
