NAME

    verify-license - verifies the integrity of elasticsearch signed license(s)

SYNOPSIS

    verify-license -l signedLicense

DESCRIPTION

    This tool assumes the configured public key to be the same as that of the production license plugin public key.
    The tool can take arbitrary number of `--license` and/or `--licenseFile` for verifying signed license(s). If any
    of the provided license(s) are invalid, the tool will error out, otherwise it will output a effective licenses file.

    Effective Licenses:
    A set of licenses that only has one effective sub-license for every feature provided through the input license file.
    Where effective sub-licenses are identified as the sub-licenses with the latest `expiry_date` for a `feature`
    and the sub-license has not already expired.
