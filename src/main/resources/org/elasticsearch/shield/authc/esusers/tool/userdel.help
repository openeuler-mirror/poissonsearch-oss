USAGE:

   esusers userdel <username>

DESCRIPTION:

   Removes an existing native user from elasticsearch. The user will be
   removed from the users file and its roles will be removed to the
   users_roles file. If non-default files are used (different file
   locations are configured in elasticsearch.yml) the appropriate files
   will be resolved from the settings and the user and its roles will be
   removed to them.
