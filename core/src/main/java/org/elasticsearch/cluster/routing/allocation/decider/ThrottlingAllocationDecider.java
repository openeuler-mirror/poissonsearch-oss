/**
 * {@link ThrottlingAllocationDecider} controls the recovery process per node in
 * the cluster. It exposes two settings via the cluster update API that allow
 * changes in real-time:
 * <ul>
 * <li><tt>cluster.routing.allocation.node_initial_primaries_recoveries</tt> -
 * restricts the number of initial primary shard recovery operations on a single
 * node. The default is <tt>4</tt></li>
 * <li><tt>cluster.routing.allocation.node_concurrent_recoveries</tt> -
 * restricts the number of total concurrent shards initializing on a single node. The
 * default is <tt>2</tt></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If one of the above thresholds is exceeded per node this allocation decider
 * will return {@link Decision#THROTTLE} as a hit to upstream logic to throttle
 * the allocation process to prevent overloading nodes due to too many concurrent recovery
 * processes.
