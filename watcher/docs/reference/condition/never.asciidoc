[[condition-never]]
==== Never Condition

A watch <<condition, condition>> that always evaluates to `false`. If you use this condition, 
the watch's actions are never executed. The watch's input is executed, a record is added to the watch history,
and processing stops. This condition is generally only used for testing.

===== Using the Never Condition

There are no attributes to specify for the `never` condition. To use the `never` condition,
you simply specify the condition type  and  associate it with an empty object:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _watcher/watch/my-watch
{
  ...

  "condition" : {
    "never" : {}
  }
  ...
}
--------------------------------------------------
