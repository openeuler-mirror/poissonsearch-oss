[[input]]
=== Input

A watch _input_ loads data into a watch's execution context as the initial payload.
Watcher supports four input types: <<input-simple, `simple`>> , <<input-search, `search`>>,
<<input-http, `http`>> and <<input-chain, `chain`>>

NOTE:   If you don't define an input for a watch, an empty payload is loaded into the
        execution context.
