==== Chain Input

An <<input, input>> that enables you to chain several inputs one after the other and have each input populating the execution context.
The `chain` input is useful when the output of one input should change the input of another or you need several inputs to gather all the
information needed for an action..

You can define the chained input as following

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "input" : {
    "chain" : {
      "inputs" : [
        "first" : {
          "simple" : { "path" : "/_search" }
        },
        "second" : {
          "http" : {
            "request" : {
              "host" : "localhost",
              "port" : 9200,
              "path" : "{{ctx.payload.first.path}}"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ...
}
--------------------------------------------------

As you can see, the name of the input (`first` and `second` in this example) can be used to access values from the context in consecutive inputs.

In case you are wondering about the structure of this input. The `inputs` must be an array, because JSON does not guarantee the order of arbitrary
objects, one has to use a list.
