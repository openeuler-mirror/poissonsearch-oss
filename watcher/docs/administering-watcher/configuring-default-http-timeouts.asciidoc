=== Configuring the Default HTTP Timeouts

All HTTP requests in watcher (e.g. used by the <<input-http, HTTP Input>> and <<actions-webhook, Webhook Action>>)
are associated with two timeouts:

Connection Timeout  ::  Determines how long should the request wait for the HTTP
                        connection to be established before failing the request.

Read Timeout        ::  Assuming the connenction was established, this timeout
                        determines how long should the request wait for a
                        response before failing the request.

By default, both timeouts are set to 10 seconds. It is possible to change this
default using the following settings in `elasticsearch.yml`:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
watcher.http.default_connection_timeout: 5s
watcher.http.default_read_timeout: 20s
--------------------------------------------------
