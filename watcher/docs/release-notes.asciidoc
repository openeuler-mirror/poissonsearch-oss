=== Upgrading Watcher

Watcher {version} is backward compatible with Watcher 1.0.x. Follow these steps to
upgrade:

   returned watches aside.

2. Stop Elasticsearch on all nodes in your cluster.

3. Uninstall the Watcher plugin from each node:
+
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
bin/plugin remove watcher
--------------------------------------------------

4. From here on you can simply follow the <<getting-started, Getting Started>> guide.
