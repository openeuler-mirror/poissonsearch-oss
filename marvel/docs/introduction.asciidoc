== Introduction

_Marvel_ is a plugin for Elasticsearch that enables you to easily monitor and manage
your Elasticsearch cluster. Marvel aggregates cluster-wide statistics and events and provides a 
Kibana app that makes it easy to view and analyze the data. 

When you open the Marvel app in Kibana, you see the key metrics that indicate the health of your 
cluster. 

From there, you can dive into the details for particular nodes and indices.
