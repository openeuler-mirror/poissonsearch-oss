= Elasticsearch X Pack

A set of Elastic's commercial plugins:

- License
- Security
- Watcher
- Monitoring
- Machine learning

= Setup
You must checkout x-pack and elasticsearch with a specific directory structure. The
elasticsearch checkout will be used when building x-pack. The structure is:

- /path/to/elastic/elasticsearch
- /path/to/elastic/elasticsearch-extra/x-pack-elasticsearch

= Build

- Run unit tests:
+
[source, txt]
-----
gradle clean test
-----

- Run all tests:
+
[source, txt]
-----
gradle clean check
-----

- Run integration tests:
+
[source, txt]
-----
gradle clean integTest
-----

- Package X-Pack (wihtout running tests)
+
[source, txt]
-----
gradle clean assemble
-----

- Install X-Pack (wihtout running tests)
+
[source, txt]
-----
gradle clean install
-----

- If you don't work on the UI/Logstash side of x-plugins, you can force gradle to skip building kibana and/or Logstash by adding
  `xpack.kibana.build=false`/`xpack.logstash.build=false` to your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`. Alternatively you add `-Pxpack.kibana.build=false` or `-Pxpack.logstash.build=false`
  on the command line if you only want to do this on individual builds (or `-Pxpack.kibana.build=true` if you need to
  override having added this to your `gradle.properties`).
