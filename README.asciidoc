= Elasticsearch X-Pack

A set of Elastic's commercial plugins for Elasticsearch:

- License
- Security
- Watcher
- Monitoring
- Machine Learning
- Graph

= Setup

You must checkout `x-pack-elasticsearch` and `elasticsearch` with a specific directory structure. The
`elasticsearch` checkout will be used when building `x-pack-elasticsearch`. The structure is:

- /path/to/elastic/elasticsearch
- /path/to/elastic/elasticsearch-extra/x-pack-elasticsearch

== Vault Secret

The build requires a Vault Secret ID. You can use a GitHub token by following these steps:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click *Generate new token*
3. Set permissions to `read:org`
4. Copy the token into `~/.elastic/github.token`
5. Set the token's file permissions to `600`

```
$ mkdir ~/.elastic
$ vi ~/.elastic/github.token
# Add your_token exactly as it is into the file and save it
$ chmod 600 ~/.elastic/github.token
```

If you do not create the token, then you will see something along the lines of this as the failure when trying to build X-Pack:

```
* What went wrong:
Missing ~/.elastic/github.token file or VAULT_SECRET_ID environment variable, needed to authenticate with vault for secrets
```

=== Offline Mode

When running the build in offline mode (`--offline`), it will not required to have the vault secret setup.

== Native Code

**This is mandatory as tests depend on it**

Machine Learning requires platform specific binaries, build from https://github.com/elastic/machine-learning-cpp via CI servers.

The native artifacts are stored in S3. To retrieve them infra's team Vault service is utilized, which 
requires a github token. Please setup a github token as documented: 

https://github.com/elastic/infra/blob/master/docs/vault.md#github-auth

The github token has to be put into ~/.elastic/github.token, while the file rights must be set to 0600.

= Building documentation

From version 5.5 onward, the source files in this repository can be included in either the X-Pack Reference or the Elasticsearch Reference. 

To build the X-Pack Reference (5.4 and later) on your local machine:

* Use the `index.asciidoc` file in the x-pack/docs/en repository.
* Specify the locations of the `x-pack-kibana/docs` and
`elasticsearch-extra/x-pack-exlasticsearch/docs` directories with
the `--resource` option when you run `build_docs.pl`.

For example:

```
docs/build_docs.pl --doc x-pack/docs/en/index.asciidoc
--resource=x-pack-kibana/docs/ --resource=elasticsearch-extra/x-pack-elasticsearch/docs/
```

To build the Elasticsearch Reference (5.5 and later) on your local machine and include the X-Pack content:

* Use the `index-all.asciidoc` file in the elasticsearch/docs/reference repository.
* Specify the location of the `elasticsearch-extra/x-pack-exlasticsearch/docs` directory with
the `--resource` option when you run `build_docs.pl`.

For example:

```
docs/build_docs.pl --doc elasticsearch/docs/reference/index-all.asciidoc --resource=elasticsearch-extra/x-pack-elasticsearch/docs/
```

== Adding Images

When you include an image in the documentation, specify the path relative to the location of the asciidoc file. By convention, we put images in an `images` subdirectory.

For example to insert `watcher-ui-edit-watch.png` in `watcher/limitations.asciidoc`:

1. Add an `images` subdirectory to the watcher directory if it doesn't already exist:

 ```
 ├── elasticsearch-extra
 │   └── x-pack-elasticsearch
 │        └── watcher
 │             └── limitations.asciidoc
 │             └── images
 │                  └── watcher-ui-edit-watch.png
 ```
2. In `limitations.asciidoc` specify:

 ```
 image::images/watcher-ui-edit-watch.png["Editing a watch"]
 ```
Please note that image names and anchor IDs must be unique within the book, so do not use generic identifiers.
