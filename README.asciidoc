= Elasticsearch X Plugins

A set of Elastic's commercial plugins:

- License
- Security
- Watcher

= Setup
You must checkout x-plugins and elasticsearch in the same directory as siblings. This
elasticsearch checkout will be used when building x-plugins.

gradle clean test

[source, txt]
-----
gradle clean check
-----

- Run integration tests:
+
[source, txt]

- If you don't work on the UI side of x-plugins, you can force gradle to skip building kibana by adding
  `xpack.kibana.build=false` to your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`. Alternatively you add `-Pxpack.kibana.build=false`
  on the command line if you only want to do this on individual builds (or `-Pxpack.kibana.build=true` if you need to
  override having added this to your `gradle.properties`).
