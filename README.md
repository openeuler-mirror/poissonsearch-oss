* [3.0.0-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-analysis-phonetic/blob/master/README.md)


A `phonetic` token filter that can be configured with different `encoder` types: 
`metaphone`, `doublemetaphone`, `soundex`, `refinedsoundex`, 
`caverphone1`, `caverphone2`, `cologne`, `nysiis`,
`koelnerphonetik`, `haasephonetik`, `beidermorse`

The `replace` parameter (defaults to `true`) controls if the token processed 
should be replaced with the encoded one (set it to `true`), or added (set it to `false`).

```js
{
    "index" : {
        "analysis" : {
            "analyzer" : {
                "my_analyzer" : {
                    "tokenizer" : "standard",
                    "filter" : ["standard", "lowercase", "my_metaphone"]
                }
            },
            "filter" : {
                "my_metaphone" : {
                    "type" : "phonetic",
                    "encoder" : "metaphone",
                    "replace" : false
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note that `beidermorse` does not support `replace` parameter.
