Mapper Attachments Type for ElasticSearch
=========================================

The mapper attachments plugin adds the `attachment` type to ElasticSearch using [Apache Tika](http://lucene.apache.org/tika/).

In order to install the plugin, simply run: `bin/plugin -install elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/1.8.0`.

The `attachment` type allows to index different "attachment" type field (encoded as `base64`), for example,
microsoft office formats, open document formats, ePub, HTML, and so on (full list can be found [here](http://tika.apache.org/1.4/formats.html)).

The `attachment` type is provided as a plugin extension. The plugin is a simple zip file that can be downloaded and placed under `$ES_HOME/plugins` location. It will be automatically detected and the `attachment` type will be added.

Using the attachment type is simple, in your mapping JSON, simply set a certain JSON element as attachment, for example:

```javascript
{
    "person" : {
        "properties" : {
            "my_attachment" : { "type" : "attachment" }
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, the JSON to index can be:

```javascript
{
    "my_attachment" : "... base64 encoded attachment ..."
}
```

Or it is possible to use more elaborated JSON if content type or resource name need to be set explicitly:

```javascript
{
    "my_attachment" : {
        "_content_type" : "application/pdf",
        "_name" : "resource/name/of/my.pdf",
        "content" : "... base64 encoded attachment ..."
    }
}
```

The `attachment` type not only indexes the content of the doc, but also automatically adds meta data on the attachment as well (when available).

The metadata supported are:

* `date`
* `title`
* `name` only available if you set `_name` see above
* `author`
* `keywords`
* `content_type`
* `content_length` is the original content_length before text extraction (aka file size)

They can be queried using the "dot notation", for example: `my_attachment.author`.

Both the meta data and the actual content are simple core type mappers (string, date, ...), thus, they can be controlled in the mappings. For example:

```javascript
{
    "person" : {
        "properties" : {
            "file" : {
                "type" : "attachment",
                "fields" : {
                    "file" : {"index" : "no"},
                    "title" : {store : "yes"},
                    "date" : {"store" : "yes"},
                    "author" : {"analyzer" : "myAnalyzer"},
                    "keywords" : {store : "yes"},
                    "content_type" : {store : "yes"},
                    "content_length" : {store : "yes"}
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, the actual content indexed is mapped under `fields` name `file`, and we decide not to index it, so it will only be available in the `_all` field. The other fields map to their respective metadata names, but there is no need to specify the `type` (like `string` or `date`) since it is already known.

Indexed Characters
------------------

By default, `100000` characters are extracted when indexing the content. This default value can be changed by setting the `index.mapping.attachment.indexed_chars` setting. It can also be provided on a per document indexed using the `_indexed_chars` parameter. `-1` can be set to extract all text, but note that all the text needs to be allowed to be represented in memory.

Note, this feature is support since `1.3.0` version.

Metadata parsing error handling
-------------------------------

While extracting metadata content, errors could happen for example when parsing dates.
Since version `1.9.0`, parsing errors are ignored so your document is indexed.

You can disable this feature by setting the `index.mapping.attachment.ignore_errors` setting to `false`.
