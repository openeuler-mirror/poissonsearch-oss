Mapper Attachments Type for Elasticsearch
=========================================

The mapper attachments plugin adds the `attachment` type to Elasticsearch using [Apache Tika](http://lucene.apache.org/tika/).

In order to install the plugin, simply run: `bin/plugin -install elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/2.0.0`.

* For master elasticsearch versions, look at [master branch](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/tree/master).
* For 1.3.x elasticsearch versions, look at [es-1.3 branch](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/tree/es-1.3).
* For 1.2.x elasticsearch versions, look at [es-1.2 branch](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/tree/es-1.2).
* For 1.1.x elasticsearch versions, look at [es-1.1 branch](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/tree/es-1.1).
* For 1.0.x elasticsearch versions, look at [es-1.0 branch](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/tree/es-1.0).
* For 0.90.x elasticsearch versions, look at [es-0.90 branch](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/tree/es-0.90).


|   Attachment Mapper Plugin  | elasticsearch         |  Tika  | Release date |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|--------|:------------:|
| 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT              | master                |  1.5   |  XXXX-XX-XX  |

Please read documentation relative to the version you are using:

* [3.0.0-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-analysis-stempel/blob/master/README.md)

The `attachment` type allows to index different "attachment" type field (encoded as `base64`), for example,
microsoft office formats, open document formats, ePub, HTML, and so on (full list can be found [here](http://tika.apache.org/1.5/formats.html)).

The `attachment` type is provided as a plugin extension. The plugin is a simple zip file that can be downloaded and placed under `$ES_HOME/plugins` location. It will be automatically detected and the `attachment` type will be added.

Using the attachment type is simple, in your mapping JSON, simply set a certain JSON element as attachment, for example:

```javascript
{
    "person" : {
        "properties" : {
            "my_attachment" : { "type" : "attachment" }
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, the JSON to index can be:

```javascript
{
    "my_attachment" : "... base64 encoded attachment ..."
}
```

Or it is possible to use more elaborated JSON if content type, resource name or language need to be set explicitly:

```javascript
{
    "my_attachment" : {
        "_content_type" : "application/pdf",
        "_name" : "resource/name/of/my.pdf",
        "_language" : "en",
        "_content" : "... base64 encoded attachment ..."
    }
}
```

The `attachment` type not only indexes the content of the doc, but also automatically adds meta data on the attachment as well (when available).

The metadata supported are:

* `date`
* `title`
* `name` only available if you set `_name` see above
* `author`
* `keywords`
* `content_type`
* `content_length` is the original content_length before text extraction (aka file size)
* `language`

They can be queried using the "dot notation", for example: `my_attachment.author`.

Both the meta data and the actual content are simple core type mappers (string, date, ...), thus, they can be controlled in the mappings. For example:

```javascript
{
    "person" : {
        "properties" : {
            "file" : {
                "type" : "attachment",
                "fields" : {
                    "file" : {"index" : "no"},
                    "title" : {"store" : "yes"},
                    "date" : {"store" : "yes"},
                    "author" : {"analyzer" : "myAnalyzer"},
                    "keywords" : {"store" : "yes"},
                    "content_type" : {"store" : "yes"},
                    "content_length" : {"store" : "yes"},
                    "language" : {"store" : "yes"}
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, the actual content indexed is mapped under `fields` name `file`, and we decide not to index it, so it will only be available in the `_all` field. The other fields map to their respective metadata names, but there is no need to specify the `type` (like `string` or `date`) since it is already known.

Indexed Characters
------------------

By default, `100000` characters are extracted when indexing the content. This default value can be changed by setting the `index.mapping.attachment.indexed_chars` setting. It can also be provided on a per document indexed using the `_indexed_chars` parameter. `-1` can be set to extract all text, but note that all the text needs to be allowed to be represented in memory.

Metadata parsing error handling
-------------------------------

While extracting metadata content, errors could happen for example when parsing dates.
Parsing errors are ignored so your document is indexed.

You can disable this feature by setting the `index.mapping.attachment.ignore_errors` setting to `false`.

Language Detection
------------------

By default, language detection is disabled (`false`) as it could come with a cost.
This default value can be changed by setting the `index.mapping.attachment.detect_language` setting.
It can also be provided on a per document indexed using the `_detect_language` parameter.

Note that you can force language using `_language` field when sending your actual document:

```javascript
{
    "my_attachment" : {
        "_language" : "en",
        "_content" : "... base64 encoded attachment ..."
    }
}
```

Highlighting attachments
------------------------

If you want to highlight your attachment content, you will need to store your file content and set `term_vector` as follow:

```
PUT test/my_type/_mapping
{
    "my_type" : {
        "properties" : {
            "my_html_file" : {
                "type" : "attachment",
                "fields" : {
                    "title" : { "store" : "yes" },
                    "my_html_file" : { "term_vector":"with_positions_offsets", "store":"yes" }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
